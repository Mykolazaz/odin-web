<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>Lasagna is a rich and hearty Italian dish made of layers of wide, flat pasta sheets alternated with a savory filling, often including seasoned ground meat, such as beef or sausage, and a blend of cheeses like ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan.
    The layers are held together with a robust, slow-simmered tomato sauce, sometimes enriched with herbs like basil and oregano for extra flavor.
    The entire dish is baked in the oven until the cheese on top is golden and bubbling, creating a deliciously crispy crust.
    Lasagna is known for its comforting, multi-layered texture, with each bite offering a balanced combination of tender pasta, creamy cheese, and flavorful sauce.</p>
