<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>Kimchi is a traditional Korean dish made from fermented vegetables, most commonly napa cabbage and radishes, seasoned with a mixture of garlic, ginger, chili pepper flakes, and fish sauce.
    The fermentation process gives kimchi its signature tangy and slightly sour flavor, while the chili peppers provide a spicy kick.
    This dish is often served as a side dish, or banchan, but can also be incorporated into soups, stews, and other meals.
    Kimchi has a bold, complex taste that balances spiciness, umami, and acidity, with a crunchy texture that comes from the crisp vegetables.
    Known for its rich probiotic content, it's both a flavorful and healthy staple of Korean cuisine.</p>

<h4>Ingredients:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>2 heads napa cabbage</li>
    <li>1 ¼ cups coarse sea salt</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce</li>
    <li>5 green onions, chopped/li>
    <li>½ small white onion, minced</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, pressed</li>

    <li>5 tablespoons gochugaru (Korean chili powder)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Steps:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Cut cabbages in half lengthwise and trim the ends. Rinse and cut into pieces about 2 inch square. Place cabbage into large resealable bags; sprinkle salt evenly over leaves to coat. Use your hands to rub salt into cabbage. Seal the bags and leave at room temperature for 6 hours.</li>
    <li>Rinse cabbage leaves under cold water, at least 2 to 3 times, to remove most of the salt; drain and squeeze out any excess liquid.</li>
    <li>Place rinsed cabbage in a large container with a tight fitting lid. Stir in fish sauce, green onions, white onion, garlic, sugar, and ginger. Sprinkle Korean chile powder over mixture.; wear plastic gloves to protect your hands and rub chile powder into cabbage leaves until evenly coated.</li>
    <li>Seal the container and set in a cool dry place. Leave undisturbed for 4 days. Refrigerate before serving, and store in the refrigerator for up to 1 month (if it lasts that long!).</li>
